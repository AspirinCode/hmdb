Welcome to the PyHMDB documentation!
====================================

PyHMDB is a package which allows the user to work with a local sqlite version of the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB).
Next to creating the local database there are also functions provided, which will enrich given Biological Expression Language (BEL) graphs with information about metabolites, proteins and diseases, that can be found in the HMDB.
PyHMDB is still under development and still lacks some aspects of HMDB. Please find more information about the current status of PyHMDB here.
